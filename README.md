# National Scenic Byways

This repository contains data obtained from the byways.org website, which
operated from 1998 to 2013 under the direction of the U.S. Federal
Highway Administration.  In late 2013 a subset of the data was moved to
internal hosting and is viewable at https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways.

The owner of this repository has access to the original PostgreSQL database,
associated file assets, and website source code.  The goal is to make the
public travel-related structured data available to the public, as it was
produced with public funding.
